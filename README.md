- 👋 Hi, I’m @CanOfBottle
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity. It seems very interesting, but there is so much to learn, and such a broad topic. I don't know any of it! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and a bit about Linux. All the linux stuff I have seen is just terminal stuff.
- I don't post much, but you can find me on Mastodon: @CanofBottle@infosec.exchange.
